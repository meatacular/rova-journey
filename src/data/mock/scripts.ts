    auckland: `Good morning Auckland. Your commute from Grey Lynn to the CBD is looking a bit slow this morning — about 27 minutes, that's roughly 9 minutes longer than usual. There's heavy congestion at the K Road and Ponsonby Road intersection as traffic merges onto the motorway. And heads up — Grafton Bridge still has that lane closure for roadworks, so give yourself a bit of extra time through there. On the way home tonight, expect the usual Spaghetti Junction slowdown heading northbound, and there's been a minor fender-bender on the Northwestern near Te Atatu that could add about 5 minutes.`,
    wellington: `Kia ora Wellington. If you're heading from Johnsonville into the CBD this morning, allow about 22 minutes — a bit longer than the usual 15 thanks to those seismic strengthening works in Ngauranga Gorge. They've got it down to a single lane, so patience is key through there. For the trip home this evening, Hutt Road will be the usual bottleneck heading north from the CBD. Allow about 25 minutes.`,
    christchurch: `Morning Christchurch! Your run from Riccarton into the CBD is sitting at about 15 minutes — not too bad, just 3 minutes over the norm. The cycleway construction on Riccarton Road has things down to one lane, so you might want to cut through Hagley Park if you're in a hurry. The drive home should be pretty smooth — just some moderate traffic on Moorhouse Avenue around 5 o'clock.`,

    wellington: `Wellington's doing its thing — 19 degrees and windy, with northerlies gusting to 40 k's an hour. Bit of a hold-onto-your-hat kind of morning. The good news? Wind should ease off this afternoon and we might see some sun, reaching 21. This evening, expect cloud and about 15 degrees. A jacket won't go amiss for the walk to the car.`,
    christchurch: `Beautiful morning in Christchurch — 27 degrees and sunny, humidity nice and low at 45 percent. Classic Canterbury summer day ahead with temperatures pushing 29 this afternoon. Evening will be clear and still warm around 23 degrees. Gorgeous conditions for the drive home tonight.`,
